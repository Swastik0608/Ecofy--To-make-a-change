                 <h3>Environmentally friendly products are market-oriented products that cause minimal environmental degradation and their production is linked to a product development process that is structured in a way that considers the impacts that can be caused to the environment throughout their life cycle. The pencils are covered with wood and increasingly with plastic. A bamboo pencil looks, sharpens, feels and writes like a conventional pencil; the user experience is unaltered. Bamboo is a locally available resource and pencil manufacture can be a household enterprise and/or create rural jobs, with a policy change in material specification. Our bamboo pencils are completely eco-friendly, biodegradable and highly durable. They come from nature and go back to it. It is comparatively cheaper and a better choice when compared to other raw wood pencils.</h3>
